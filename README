* Formatting Tools, Version 1 (BETA)                    -*- outline -*-

This directory contains a library for formatting output in relatively
portable Scheme.

This code is in a preliminary state, and only lightly tested.  It is
not very fast, and its design is unfinished, because it lacks any sort
of backward information flow, rendering it useless for such purposes as
pretty-printing.  There is no documentation.

To load this library into Scheme48, load s48-interfaces.scm and
s48-packages.scm into the config package.

This library depends on

- SRFI 6, Basic String Ports,
- SRFI 8, RECEIVE,
- SRFI 9, DEFINE-RECORD-TYPE,
- SRFI 23, ERROR,
- a (WRITE-STRING <string> <output-port>) procedure that can be defined
  simply to be DISPLAY, and
- a procedure (NO-OP <value>) that returns <value>.

The intent of the NO-OP procedure is that the compiler not integrate
its definition in-line, and thereby force <value> to be evaluated, so
that any free variables in <value> will be included in closure
environments for later debugging reference.
